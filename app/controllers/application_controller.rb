# everytime we make a request, a new instance of our appcontroller is instantiated
# @variable gets reset with every call to HTTP
# you could write all code here if you wanted to but it's not clean

# don't access model from the view - use @movies instead of Movie.all in the view files
# in the model, make @movies = Movie.all

# erb has to be a string. sinatra renders things to string in the views

# rack flash can go here and will trickle to the other controllers outside the class
#     inside class there's the method calling use rack-flash
